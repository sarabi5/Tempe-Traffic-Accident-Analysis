# Tempe-Traffic-Accident-Analysis
This repository contains R code and analysis of traffic accident data from the Tempe Open Data Portal. The project explores patterns in accident frequency, harm rates, and demographic factors such as driver age and time of day.

Link to dataset: https://data.tempe.gov/datasets/tempegov::1-08-crash-data-report-detail/about

The dataset includes detailed information on traffic accidents, such as: 1) Date and time of incident, 2) Location details (e.g., street names and distances), 3) Collision type, 4) Injury and fatality counts, and 5) Demographic data (e.g., driver age)

Key Components:
Data Preprocessing: Time and age features were extracted and categorized.
Part I: Summarized accidents by weekday and harm rates.
Part II: Analyzed accident patterns across driver age groups and time of day.
Part III: Assessed accident frequency and severity by hour.


This project was completed as part of CPP 526: Found Data Sci I: Data Prog R (2023 Summer) at Arizona State University.
